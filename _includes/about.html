        <p>
          Hello! This is Jina Kim (ê¹€ì§€ë‚˜ in Korean). I am a second-year PhD student in the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs">Computer Science & Engineering Department</a> at the University of Minnesota and a member of <a href="http://knowledge-computing.github.io">Knowledge Computing Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://yaoyichi.github.io">Prof. Yao-Yi Chiang</a>.
          <br><br>
          My research interests lie in <em>spatial artificial intelligence</em> and <em>multimodal learning</em>.
          I mainly focus on developing techniques to automatically extract meaningful information from large-scale, multimodal spatial data.
          Heterogeneous spatial data includes overhead images, trajectories, and documents such as scanned images (e.g., scanned maps) or natural language documents containing valuable geographic information.
          I am also interested in validating technologies beyond accuracy by using social science methodologies.
          For more information about my research experience, please refer to my <a href='/Jina_Kim_CV.pdf' style="text-decoration: underline">Curriculum Vitae (PDF)</a>.
          <br><br>
          I obtained my Master's degree in <a href="http://is.skku.edu">Interaction Science</a> from Sungkyunkwan University under <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/eunil">Prof. Eunil Park</a>'s supervision where I found my passion in conducting interdisciplinary research to solve real-world problems.
          During my Master's, I have completed the Intensive Artificial Intelligence Program offered by the <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu">Language Technologies Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University.
          Before that I received my Bachelor's degree in <a href="https://www.hansung.ac.kr/Engineering/1176/subview.do">Computer Engineering</a> from Hansung University.
